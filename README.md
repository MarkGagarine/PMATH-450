# PMATH-450
This repository contains selected works from my second Real Analysis course (PMATH-450) taken in Summer 2024 with Professor Alexandru Nica. It includes the current rendition of my typeset notes taken in class, along with my final project on the Hamburger moment problem and its connection to the Lanczos algorithm.
